# PDF Text-to-Speech Reader

Welcome! This is a simple and beginner-friendly Python application I built that brings your PDF documents to life by reading their text aloud. Whether you want to listen to an entire PDF, just one page, or a range of pages, this tool has you covered with clear, natural-sounding narration.

## What It Does

- Lets you pick any PDF file easily through a friendly graphical window.
- Reads the whole document, a single page, or any custom page range you choose.
- Speaks at a slightly slowed-down pace to make every word clear.
- Adds a short, 1-second pause between pages so listening feels smooth and comfortable.
- Shows messages in the console so you can track the progress or know if any pages are skipped.
- Works completely offline using pyttsx3 for text-to-speech.
- Reliably extracts text from PDFs using PyPDF2.

## Why I Made This

As a beginner exploring Python, I wanted to create something practical and fun. This project is perfect for students, busy folks, or anyone who prefers listening over reading. It’s also helpful for people with visual impairments or those who struggle with reading. Plus, it gave me valuable experience with file handling, user input, and making Python talk!

## How to Get Started

1. Clone this repo to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-text-to-speech-reader.git

2. Open a terminal and go to the project folder:
cd pdf-text-to-speech-reader

3. Install the required Python packages:
pip install pyttsx3 PyPDF2

4. Run the program:
python main.py

## What’s Next?

I’m excited to keep improving this project by adding features like customizable voice options, bookmarking, and enhanced user interface elements to make your audiobook experience even better. For now, I hope you enjoy this handy tool as much as I enjoyed creating it!
